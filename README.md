# A different approach to tech headhunting

Yes, here it is: we got rid of our very old Wordpress website. It was slow and not functioning well, so we thought: why not try GitHub pages?

We are aware that it is not a revolutionary idea, but we like to think that it is a way to demonstrate that when we promise our clients a very high level of specialization in the tech industry, it is not just an empty phrase.

Even today, the recruiting sector for tech professionals is a jungle, in which many still have not understood the difference between Java and Javascript. Since 2016, we have been trying to develop a new way of understanding recruiting: on one hand, by providing valuable insights to our clients to help them navigate the job market; on the other hand, by offering the best possible candidate experience starting from the very first contact message. We have even written a [Manifesto](https://github.com/bluepartners/Manifesto/blob/master/README.md) to publicly commit ourselves to this effort!

If you are a company or a professional interested in discovering how we work, please feel free to contact us: [hello@pops-tech.com](mailto:hello@pops-tech.com)

We built our new website trying to have fun with some of the recent new technologies. We used [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) as the framework and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for CSS. We took inspiration from the various available themes, with special thanks to [Hello Astro](https://github.com/hellotham/hello-astro) for the great ideas. The images are from [unDraw](https://undraw.co/), while the icons come from [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).
